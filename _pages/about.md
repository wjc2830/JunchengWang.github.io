# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University** (QS: 54th, USNews: 58th), advised by **Prof. Emma Shujun Wang**. My thesis is titled *"Clone Your Instance: Towards Omni-Modality Creation of Digital Twins with Real-Time Interactions"*.

My research interests span a spectrum of **world models**, **multi-modality content generation**, **omni-language models**, **diffusion models**, and **reinforcement learning**. I am interested in advancing cooperative multi-modal artificial intelligence generative content (MMAIGC) by addressing key challenges in real-time interactive content generation. Specifically, my research draws on foundational mechanisms and principles from MMAIGC, and operationalizes them into world models capable of exhibiting multi-modality generation.
